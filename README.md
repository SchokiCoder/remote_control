# This is canceled

This project was deserted, and after years of inactivity I looked at it...  
Yeah this is bad...  

# Identity crisis

This entire thing _subtly_ tries not to borrow too many TF2 things,
in order to have its own identity.  

On top of that,
the whole _control via command line_ shtick proved to be cumbersome in use.
I did have a gui-oriented approach,
but it went against the theme and whole idea,
and I lost all interest because of that.  

# My good old bad code

The formatting is a nightmare, my lib's are a nightmare, and I am in pain,
just from looking at it.  
There had been many questionable design decisions, like error handling.  

# Future?

This current concept will not have a future. I think I have an idea,
but that changes everything and thus would deserve a new repo.
